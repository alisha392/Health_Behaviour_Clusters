# Description
This repository contains code used in the statsistical analysis for the paper titled "Longitudinal clustering of health behaviours and their association with multimorbidity in older adults in England: A latent class analysis" by Alisha Suhag, Thomas L. Webb and John Holmes

Using repeated measures latent class analysis, this research analyses data from a longitudinal panel of older adults in England to: i) explore how the SNAP behaviours (i.e. smoking, unhealthy nutrition, alcohol consumption and physical inactivity) cluster over time in older adults, ii) investigate how membership in different behavioural clusters varies by socio-demographic characteristics, and iii) examine which, if any, behavioural clusters are prospectively associated with multimorbidity over time.

# Prerequisites
The data used in the analysis can be accessed on UK Data Service :

Banks, J., Batty, G. David, Breedvelt, J., Coughlin, K., Crawford, R., Marmot, M., Nazroo, J., Oldfield, Z., Steel, N., Steptoe, A., Wood, M., Zaninotto, P. (2022). English Longitudinal Study of Ageing: Waves 0-9, 1998-2019. [data collection]. 37th Edition. UK Data Service. SN: 5050, DOI: 10.5255/UKDA-SN-5050-24

The workflow from the project has been maintained in the repository. For replicating the study or using the current code for analysing ELSA data, you can add the data downloaded from UK Data Service to the Data/Raw_Data/Original_ELSA_Data folder.
